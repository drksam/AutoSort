An app that will run on windows 
that monitors a directory for new scans (PDF)
then compares the new scan to the files in a set of directories 
decides the correct directory 
renames the file "DIR_DATE_TIME" using the chosen directory as DIR and current date and time
then moves the file to that directory 
we do not need a formal ui we can set up locations with a config file 


there is a buildlog.md log all progress, errors corrected, lessons learned and anything info that will help as we move allong
there is a readme.md please include instructions for other users.
